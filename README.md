## Dataset
`Pittsburgh Internet Service Providers By Block` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-internet-service-providers-by-block-june-2016
The Internet has become an inseparable part of people's daily life. The best neighborhoods must have extremely high internet speeds. We can't imagine living in a place without internet access. In all the datasets I use, the number of ISPs is used as a rule to judge.

`Police Incident Blotter From 2015 - 2022` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data
"Safety" is a strong submetric for "living quality". This data set has data on police incidents in Pittsburgh over a span of 7 years. The idea is that less amount of police incidents correlates to a safer/better neighborhood. I plan on using the csv file in order to find the neighborhood with the least amount of police incidents to determine which one is "best".

`Allegheny County COVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths` ï¼šhttps://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-covid-19-tests-cases-and-deaths 
This data is about the distribution of COVID-19. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that, once it's found in one area, can spread to other people and in some way cause death. So,we can say that the lower the number of infections and deaths in an area, the safer it is. Also, the covid distribution is a straightforward and clear way to describe safty level.


## Overview
A three-person project using Python3, Jupyter Notebook, geopandas, and the pandas library to answer the question, "What is the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh?"
