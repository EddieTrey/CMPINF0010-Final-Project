## Dataset
`Allegheny County Air Quality` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality
There is no doubt that air quality has an important impact on the living environment of people. Poor air quality can easily lead to respiratory diseases and even cancer. And good air quality can make residents happy without these problems

`Allegheny County Restaurant/Food Facility Inspections and Locations` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data
According to the World Health Organization(WHO), about 1 in 10 people fall ill each year due to consuming contaminated food. Food is consumed everyday and we want the neighborhood, we will eventually select, to be one that ensures the food it handles and produces is safe for consumption.


`Allegheny County Crash Data` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-crash-data
Safety has a great impact on the quality of a community. Whether a community is safe or not also depends on the frequency of dangerous accidents. Relatively low accidents can give residents a safe living atmosphere.
