## Dataset
`Allegheny County Air Quality` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality
There is no doubt that air quality has an important impact on the living environment of people. Poor air quality can easily lead to respiratory diseases and even cancer. And good air quality can make residents happy without these problems

`Police Incident Blotter From 2015 - 2022` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data
"Crime rate" is a strong submetric for "living quality". This data set has data on police incidents in Pittsburgh over a span of 7 years. The idea is that less amount of police incidents correlates to a safer/better neighborhood. I plan on using the csv file in order to find the neighborhood with the least amount of police incidents to determine which one is "best".


`Allegheny County Crash Data` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-crash-data
Safety has a great impact on the quality of a community. Whether a community is safe or not also depends on the frequency of dangerous accidents. Relatively low accidents can give residents a safe living atmosphere.


## Overview
A three-person project using Python3, Jupyter Notebook, geopandas, and the pandas library to answer the question, "What is the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh?"
