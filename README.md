## Dataset
`Pittsburgh Internet Service Providers By Block` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-internet-service-providers-by-block-june-2016
The Internet has become an inseparable part of people's daily life. The best neighborhoods must have extremely high internet speeds. We can't imagine living in a place without internet access. In all the datasets I use, the number of ISPs is used as a rule to judge.

`Police Incident Blotter From 2015 - 2022` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data
"Safety" is a strong submetric for "living quality". This data set has data on police incidents in Pittsburgh over a span of 7 years. The idea is that less amount of police incidents correlates to a safer/better neighborhood. I plan on using the csv file in order to find the neighborhood with the least amount of police incidents to determine which one is "best".


`Allegheny County Crash Data` : https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-crash-data
Safety has a great impact on the quality of a community. Whether a community is safe or not also depends on the frequency of dangerous accidents. Relatively low accidents can give residents a safe living atmosphere.


## Overview
A three-person project using Python3, Jupyter Notebook, geopandas, and the pandas library to answer the question, "What is the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh?"
